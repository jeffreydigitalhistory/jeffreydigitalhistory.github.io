My growth as a historian over the term I believe has gone quite well and I feel like I have made progress over the course! I think in comparison to how I would have tried to view data and question things has only expanded since; the introduction of different and thought provoking topics and different ways to interpret and manipulate data has only added more ways to my repertoire in terms of moving forward and seeing things. In particular, I think it has extenuated my (in my opinion) curious and inquisitive nature when it comes to things, especially when it came to questioning the author’s methodologies and conclusions in the capstone exercise.   

One of the greatest weaknesses that I’ve discovered is probably my scatterbrained nature when it comes to a multitude of choices. If I’m given 10 different options (much like for the second last module), I won’t know what to focus on and then only do a couple at a relatively shallow level rather than if I were given one or two options, I would have likely fleshed them out in way more detail. This also was shown a bit when I was trying to decide on a capstone project. For option 1, we had the option to pursue the project in any which way, with a variety of different toolsets but I found myself unable to really land on a specific thing that would be meaningful so I opted to do option 2 where I could instead build on someone’s existing project.   

On the other hand, one of my greatest strengths is likely my technical background and ability to learn new things. I found it helped in terms of understanding a lot of the content that was presented in the course and contribute more in discussions and work because of it. In particular, I just took a course on intelligent systems prior to this and I think having that course under my belt really helped me wrap my brain around a good chunk of the concepts that we learned, especially in the middle to end of the course when we got into things such as topic modelling and clustering of data. In terms of learning, I found new technologies that I wasn’t as familiar with such as R relatively easy to adapt to because of my background and aptitude in this field.  

Overall, I’ve enjoyed my time in this course and would highly recommend it to others interested in this field! It definitely wasn’t a cakewalk and I’m glad there was pretext along those lines but it was worth the struggle!
