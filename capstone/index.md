I found the methodology of trying to analyze Google Trends a cool take on trying to analyze interest on a topic. That being said, it does have its own limitations from a digital point of view and from a methodological point of view.   

One of the limitations on the technology is due to how Google Trends interprets the data. The author himself alludes to how it is relative and not really objectively solid numbers being used. That is, when using population as a factor, the number of searches relative to the overall population might be smaller and thus overall misleading. Another potential weakness is purely using the terms “residential schools” as an indication of the interest of the entire matter. When it comes to people and searching, it can be a very finicky subject since people find many different ways of perusing information than others. That is, people might find other words and terminology to get the same information and thus the terms “residential schools” may not be the best way to measure the topic at hand. I did like how he went into variations of the different terminology which yielded interesting results such as potential racism or ignorance when looking up terms like “aboriginals” vs “Indians” but I think in general, there are some holes when it comes to looking up based on specific terms and using that as an indication of interest on the topic as a whole.  

Luckily enough, it seems that a Google trend does have the concept of “topics” when looking up concepts. It is possible that at the time, the author did not have access to these resources and thus it wouldn’t have been possible to try and address this. In either case, I have included a picture of it as follows to try and address this potential weakness. I’ve also included the other search as a comparison to see what the potential difference could be between the two:

The trends that the author spoke of are actually still well defined in the first graph as it still indicates that students are a large proportion of the search results on the topic. In fact, the topic itself seems to be a mirror of the search term itself but in larger relative proportions. However, the similarities stop based off the trends in when it was searched. If you look at where it was searched, the geomap shows some different results: the term being searched was limited to a few provinces but for the topic it is country wide, in particular in the Northwest territories and in Nunavut. If you were to base it off of populations as the author did, Saskatchewan and Manitoba still are still a heavier subset of the more populated areas in terms of search trends.  


One other thing that bothered me was that one of the conclusions was that residential schools is steadily losing interest in the eyes of the public based off the graphs and trends. However, is it the idea of residential schools that people do not have interest or aboriginal peoples in general and their plight? I did another comparison between related topics that have increasingly generalized views on the same topic: starting from residential schools in Canada to indigenous peoples in Canada to just aboriginals. The graph is as follows:  

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1845_RC03/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/03sn3t","geo":"CA","time":"all"},{"keyword":"/m/01bw2f","geo":"CA","time":"all"},{"keyword":"aboriginal","geo":"CA","time":"all"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&geo=CA&q=%2Fm%2F03sn3t,%2Fm%2F01bw2f,aboriginal","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

Therefore, the overall trend is downward sloping which is no surprise that a subset of the topic, that is residential schools, is also on a downward trend in being searched. Therefore, maybe the answer shouldn’t be “more awareness for residential schools” but “more awareness for aboriginals” in general and their plights will surface with the increase in awareness of the general topic.  

Overall, I merely tried to expand on the mythologies that the author did in his report and make my own conclusions on it. I went on my hunch that the search term lookup was not a good choice but ultimately was proven generally wrong since it showed similar results when it was shown side by side with the topic.

In terms of what someone else might want to further extend on, I would try and look up another avenue of statistics to try and either support or disprove this data. One of the datasets I was trying to find (but to no avail) was some public google analytic data that could have been pulled on how people were viewing webpages that had residential school information on it. This may be too hard, or even impossible, to actually get but it may shed some more light on the trends of what people find – are they finding aboriginal data through other means such as being shared through social media or news or are google searches enough of an indication of the overall sentiment of a topic?
